# Accuracy and Equity in Hot-spot policing
Code for capstone project

Abstract - Several recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of proactive policing strategies for crime prevention. By predicting emerging geographic hot-spots of violent crime, we can target police patrols and other interventions. However, predictive policing creates moral and ethical concerns, such as fairness and equity, which have been well-documented, yet have not been typically incorporated into the design and evaluation of such systems. In this work we develop machine learning methods to predict hot-spots of crime and present a way to measure equity among those areas. We then adjust the predictions based on the defined equity metric and analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and equity. We also see the performance of the two models based on the racial distribution of the targeted population.
