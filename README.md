# (Ongoing) Fairness and Equity in Hot-spot policing
Code for capstone project

By predicting emerging geographic hot-spots of violent
crime, we can target police patrols and other interventions to reduce the societal harms resulting
from violence. The recent National Institute of Justice Crime Forecasting Challenge compared
the predictive accuracy of multiple machine learning approaches using historical data from
Portland, Oregon. However, given that different societal processes (e.g., gangs, substance abuse,
and mental health) may be driving the patterns of violent crime in different jurisdictions, it is
not yet known which methodological approaches achieve high accuracy across cities. Moreover,
predictive policing creates moral and ethical concerns, such as fairness and equity, which have
been well-documented yet have not typically been incorporated into the design and evaluation
of such systems. Thus the goal of this project is to use open crime data from multiple urban
areas in order to develop and evaluate multiple machine learning methods with respect to both
effectiveness and equity. The team will create appropriate evaluation metrics and will develop
approaches that optimize these metrics across multiple cities, with the goals of producing fairer,
more effective, and more generalizable predictive policing methods.
